# xRandomTweaks
xRandomTweaks is an all purpose Xposed module for modifications in apps that I use
## Main features
xRandomTweaks includes the following modifications:
- GBoard: brings back old round corner scale, if you think it's too rounded
- MIUI Home: fixed algorithm for measuring the vertical gap between cells. originally the gap was too big below 270 dpi, which caused the 5. row to be behind the favourites bar
- EggInc: prevents the music from starting when you start the game. originally if you turned the music off, the music starts for a moment, and then stops
- AIMP: brings back the good old AIMP logo to the lock screen album art, and the ability to restart the music if you long press the pause button on your headset
## Future plans
- Add more apps, and more modifications
